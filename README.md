👋 Hi, I’m Victoria Nikolaeva

Currently a student at Univeristy of Delaware, studying Computer Science with a minor in Interactive Media Design. I am a creative individual in the world of tech, it is one hell of a combo! I live for design and hope to be able to showcase not only my technical but also my creative sides here!

👀 I’m interested particualrly UX/UI Design, Web Developement, Software Engineering, and even Project Management

💞️ I have been working on small projects to learn and improve my skills as a developer both in the class and on my own time. I have two githubs, that I am working on combining, so feel free to check it out after checking out this git profile!
